Le pr\u00e9sent jeu de donn\u00e9es renseigne \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle nationale : - le nombre de personnes test\u00e9es et le nombre de personnes d\u00e9clar\u00e9es positives par sexe et classe d'\u00e2ge (quotidien et hebdomadaire). Le taux de positivit\u00e9 correspond au nombre de tests positifs rapport\u00e9s au nombre de tests r\u00e9alis\u00e9s. Il est calcul\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re suivante : 100*nombre de test positif/ nombre de tests r\u00e9alis\u00e9s Pr\u00e9cisions : Si plusieurs pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements sont rapport\u00e9s pour un m\u00eame patient: - S\u00e9lection de la premi\u00e8re date pour les pcr ayant le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat (par exemple premi\u00e8re date si plusieurs pcr n\u00e9gatives) - Si pcr discordantes chez un m\u00eame patient (N et P), la premi\u00e8re pcr positive est conserv\u00e9e. Exclusion des r\u00e9sultats ininterpr\u00e9tables - A compter du 29/08, les indicateurs issus des donn\u00e9es de laboratoires (SI-DEP) pr\u00e9sentent des taux d\u2019incidence, de positivit\u00e9 et de d\u00e9pistage corrig\u00e9s en fonction des d\u00e9pistages r\u00e9alis\u00e9s dans les a\u00e9roports \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des vols internationaux. La correction s\u2019applique sur l\u2019ensemble des donn\u00e9es post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la date du 12 ao\u00fbt. Limites : - Seuls les tests biologiques des personnes pour lesquelles le d\u00e9partement de r\u00e9sidence a pu \u00eatre localis\u00e9 sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sur les cartes. Les personnes dont le d\u00e9partement n\u2019a pas pu \u00eatre remont\u00e9 dans les donn\u00e9es SIDEP ne sont comptabilis\u00e9es qu'au niveau France enti\u00e8re. De ce fait la somme des tests indiqu\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9partements ou r\u00e9gions est inf\u00e9rieure au nombre de tests indiqu\u00e9 en France. - Le d\u00e9lai de remont\u00e9e des tests peut exc\u00e9der 9 jours dans certains cas. Les indicateurs sont ajust\u00e9s quotidiennement selon la r\u00e9ception des r\u00e9sultats.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects.

Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach. These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.

URLs and Email Addresses \u00b6 To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets. <https://www.markdownguide.org> <fake@example.com> The rendered output looks like this: https://www.markdownguide.org fake@example.com Formatting Links \u00b6 To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. To denote links as code , add backticks in the brackets. I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**. This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*. See the section on [`code`](#code). The rendered output looks like this: I love supporting the EFF . This is the Markdown Guide . See the section on code . Reference-style Links \u00b6 Reference-style links are a special kind of link that make URLs easier to display and read in Markdown. Reference-style links are constructed in two parts: the part you keep inline with your text and the part you store somewhere else in the file to keep the text easy to read. Formatting the First Part of the Link \u00b6 The first part of a reference-style link is formatted with two sets of brackets. The first set of brackets surrounds the text that should appear linked. The second set of brackets displays a label used to point to the link you're storing elsewhere in your document. Although not required, you can include a space between the first and second set of brackets. The label in the second set of brackets is not case sensitive and can include letters, numbers, spaces, or punctuation. This means the following example formats are roughly equivalent for the first part of the link: [hobbit-hole][1] [hobbit-hole] [1] Formatting the Second Part of the Link \u00b6 The second part of a reference-style link is formatted with the following attributes: The label, in brackets, followed immediately by a colon and at least one space (e.g., [label]: ). The URL for the link, which you can optionally enclose in angle brackets. The optional title for the link, which you can enclose in double quotes, single quotes, or parentheses. This means the following example formats are all roughly equivalent for the second part of the link: [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle \"Hobbit lifestyles\" [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle 'Hobbit lifestyles' [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle (Hobbit lifestyles) [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> \"Hobbit lifestyles\" [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> 'Hobbit lifestyles' [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> (Hobbit lifestyles) You can place this second part of the link anywhere in your Markdown document. Some people place them immediately after the paragraph in which they appear while other people place them at the end of the document (like endnotes or footnotes). An Example Putting the Parts Together \u00b6 Say you add a URL as a standard URL link to a paragraph and it looks like this in Markdown: In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a [hobbit-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle \"Hobbit lifestyles\"), and that means comfort. Though it may point to interesting additional information, the URL as displayed really doesn't add much to the existing raw text other than making it harder to read. To fix that, you could format the URL like this instead: In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a [hobbit-hole][1], and that means comfort. [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> \"Hobbit lifestyles\" In both instances above, the rendered output would be identical: In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document? The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications available \u2014 everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing. Like Dillinger, they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in web browsers. Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a \"parser\" or an \"implementation\") to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below. Note: The Markdown application and processor are two separate components. For the sake of brevity, I've combined them into one element (\"Markdown App\") in the figure below. To summarize, this is a four-part process: Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension. Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application. Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.

Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn't like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One ). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold** ). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you're accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Atom text editor . You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown. Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that's okay. According to Gruber , Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn't rendered. The overriding design goal for Markdown\u2019s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it\u2019s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.","title":"What is markdown"},{"location":"extern/md-guide/_getting-started/what-is-markdown/#what-is-markdown","text":"Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery lists. Here are some examples of what you can do with Markdown. Websites \u00b6 Markdown was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content. If you're looking for the simplest possible way to create a website with Markdown files, check out blot.im and smallvictori.es . After you sign up for one of these services, they create a Dropbox folder on your computer. Just drag and drop your Markdown files into the folder and \u2014 poof! \u2014 they're on your website.

If you'd like to use a content management system (CMS) to power your website, take a look at Ghost . It's a free and open-source blogging platform with a nice Markdown editor. If you're a WordPress user, you'll be happy to know there's Markdown support for websites hosted on WordPress.com. Self-hosted WordPress sites can use the Jetpack plugin . Documents \u00b6 Markdown doesn't have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word, but it's good enough for creating basic documents like assignments and letters. You can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML file format. The PDF part is key, because once you have a PDF document, you can do anything with it \u2014 print it, email it, or upload it to a website. Here are some Markdown document authoring applications I recommend: Mac: MacDown , iA Writer , or Marked iOS / Android: iA Writer Windows: ghostwriter or Markdown Monster Linux: ReText or ghostwriter Web: Dillinger or StackEdit Tip: iA Writer provides templates for previewing, printing, and exporting Markdown-formatted documents. For example, the \"Academic \u2013 MLA Style\" template indents paragraphs and adds double sentence spacing. Notes \u00b6 In nearly every way, Markdown is the ideal syntax for taking notes. Sadly, Evernote and OneNote , two of the most popular note applications, don't currently support Markdown. The good news is that several other note applications do support Markdown: Simplenote is a free, barebones note-taking application available for every platform. Notable is a note-taking application that runs on a variety of platforms. Bear is an Evernote-like application available for Mac and iOS devices. It doesn't exclusively use Markdown by default, but you can enable Markdown compatibility mode. Boostnote bills itself as an \"open source note-taking app designed for programmers.\" If you can't part with Evernote, check out Marxico , a subscription-based Markdown editor for Evernote, or use Markdown Here with the Evernote website. Books \u00b6 Looking to self-publish a novel? Try Leanpub , a service that takes your Markdown-formatted files and turns them into an electronic book. Leanpub outputs your book in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI file format. If you'd like to create paperback copies of your book, you can upload the PDF file to another service such as Kindle Direct Publishing . To learn more about writing and self-publishing a book using Markdown, read this blog post . Presentations \u00b6 Believe it or not, you can generate presentations from Markdown-formatted files. Creating presentations in Markdown takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's a lot faster and easier than using an application like PowerPoint or Keynote. Remark ( GitHub project ) is a popular browser-based Markdown slideshow tool, as is Cleaver ( GitHub project ). If you use a Mac and would prefer to use an application, check out Deckset or Marked . Email \u00b6 If you send a lot of email and you're tired of the formatting controls available on most email provider websites, you'll be happy to learn there's an easy way to write email messages using Markdown. Markdown Here is a free and open-source browser extension that converts Markdown-formatted text into HTML that's ready to send.

That's in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format. Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system. Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you're using stops working at some point in the future, you'll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely. Markdown is everywhere.
