Seure shell is a protocol to safely administrying remote servers.

Underlying entcryption techniques used:

- symmetrical encryption: type of entcryption where one key can be used to

  Also called *shared secret* or *secret key* encryption, typically one single
  key  for all operations, or a pair of keys.
