# GIT

## Configuration

The configuration is made out of [four files](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#FILES):

- `$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config`
- `~/.gitconfig`
- `$GIT_DIR/config`

Add credential cache (timed out daemon) when not using ssh authentication:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
# Set the timeout to 300s instead 900s (defaut)
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=300'
# To explicitly exits the daemon
git credential-cache exit
```

## Revision selection

### Individual commit selection

#### SHA1 selection

Git allows selection of a single commit by its full 40 char. SHA1-hash.

- `git log <OPTIONS>` to display and locate commits. Ouptut format can be heavily customized.
- `git reflog` show local editions
- `git show <COMMIT>` to inspect a specific commit, for reflog specific entries, `@{<n>}` can be used to display history, e.g. `git show HEAD@{5}` will show the fifth entry of your reflog
- `git rev-parse <OPTIONS>`, belonging to *plumbing* tools can be used to investigate revisons at a lower lever


#### Ancestry selection

An ancestry can be selected by adding a `^` (caret) at the end of a reference, e.g. `HEAD^` to select the element's parent. Several carets can be used to select the parent in direct line or `~` (tilde). A parent sibling branch is selected by using a number next to the caret.

### Range selection

#### Double dot

Enable to see commits between two history points that can be on different branches, e.g.:

!!! Examples ""

    ```bash
    # Show what is beeing pulled (what's between HEAD and origin/master)
    git log --pretty=oneline -n 10 HEAD..origin/master

    # Show a branch history (master to parent's commit o new_branch)
    git log master..new_branch^
    ```

### Exclude reachable commit

This can be done with `^` before the commit or branch or by using thee `--not` syntax. e.g. to see all commits reachable from `refA` and `refB` but not `refC`:

!!! Examples ""

    ```bash
    # Usage are equivalent
    git log revA revB ^revC
    git log revA revB --not revC

    # Usage are equivalent
    git log revA..revB
    git log ^revA revB
    git log rebB --not revA
    ```

### Mutualy exclution: triple dot

Specify commits that are reachabel either by both references

## Submodules

### Commands

`status` prints the SHA1 status of checked submodules. Prefixed with:

- **-** if the submodule is not initialized
- **+** in case of conflicts between current subdmodule and the index of the containing directory
- **U** in case of merge conflicts

### Remove a submodule

A submodule can be deleted by running `git rm <submodule path> && git commit`. `$GIT_DIR/modules/<name>` delete the submodule completly. Util then, deletion can be undone using `git revert`.

Alternative method:

Remove the submodule entry from .git/config
```
git submodule deinit -f path/to/submodule
```

Remove the submodule directory from the superproject's .git/modules directory
```
rm -rf .git/modules/path/to/submodule
```

Commit the changes
```
 git commit-m "Removed submodule "
```

Remove the entry in .gitmodules and remove the submodule directory located at path/to/submodule
```
git rm -f path/to/submodule
```

### Updating submodule url and branch

The [submodule configuration](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-submoduleltnamegturl) can be displayed with `git config`:
```terminal
git config -l
```
A specific config file can be given to `git config` with the `--file` [flag](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt---fileconfig-file):

```terminal
git config -l --file=.gitmodules

```

Url, branch and [other parameters](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-submoduleltnamegturl) can be configured via `git config`

```terminal
git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.<submodule_name>.url <git@github.com:username/repository.git>
git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.<submodule_name>.branch <branch_name>
```

Synchronization adn update of the submodules are done with:

```terminal
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote --merge
# ! If --merge option is missing, HEAD will be detached
```

### Tags

Get the most recent tag:

```terminal
git describe --tags --abbrev=0
```

## Hooks

Hooks <badge-doc
href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks'></badge-doc> are
executable scripts, generaly located in `.git/hooks`. They can be devided into
two groups:

- client-side
- server-side

### Client side

| `pre-commit`         | before commiting message, general checks like linting                                                                                               |
| `prepare-commit-msg` | before the commit message editor is fired up but after the default message is created, good for commits where the default message is auto-generated |

| `pre-rebase`         | before you rebase anything                                                                                                                          |
| `pre-push `          | during `git push`, after the remote refs have been updated but before any objects have been transferred                                             |
| `post-rewrite`       | triggered by commands that replace commits, such as `git commit --amend` and `git rebase`                                                           |
| `post-merge`         | after a successful `merge` command                                                                                                                  |
| `post-commit`        | once eveything coompleted.                                                                                                                          |


There are other hooks, invoked by specific commands:

- `pre-auto-gc` by invoking garbage collection `git gc --auto`
- `applypatch-msg`, `pre-applypatch` and `post-applypatch` all invoked by `git
  am` for an email-based workflow.

??? example "Post commit"

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # Update a superproject when a commit is made to a submodule.
    # Intended for .git/**modules/{THE_SUBMODULE}/hooks/post-commit
    # where the double-star indicates variadic path elements.
    #
    # Depends on Git >= 2.13.

    # Clean the Git environment before crossing repository boundaries.
    # From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36196548
    while read variable; do
        unset $variable
    done < <(env | grep "^GIT_" | sed 's/=.*//g')

    COMMIT_MSG=$(git log --format=%B -n 1)
    GIT="git"
    SUPERPROJECT_WORKING_TREE=`git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree`

    echo "📣 Committing to $SUPERPROJECT_WORKING_TREE."

    cd $SUPERPROJECT_WORKING_TREE
    $GIT add .
    $GIT commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"
    ```

### Server side

| Hook           | Run description                                                                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pre-receive`  | first script to run when handling a push from a client. Runs only once.                        |
| `post-receive` | run once for each branch the pusher is trying to update                                        |
| `update`       | after the entire process is completed and can be used to update other services or notify users |

Installation must be performed on the server, see e.g. for
[gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/server_hooks.html). If no
admin rights are available, some alternatives:

- webhooks
  [github](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks)/[gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html)
- CI/CD pipeline
  [github](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions)
  [gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/README.html)
- push rules [gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/push_rules/push_rules.html)


## Cherry pick from another repository

First the other repository source must be added to the remote list
```
git remote add other https://other.url/repository.git
git fetch other
```

Then use [`git cherry-pick`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick)

??? info "Conventional commits"

    # Conventional Commits 1.0.0

    ## Summary

    The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of
    commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit
    commit history;
    which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
    This convention dovetails with [SemVer](http://semver.org),
    by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit
    messages.

    The commit message should be structured as follows:

    ---

    ```
    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer(s)]
    ```
    ---

    <br />
    The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent
    to the consumers of your library:

    1. **fix:** a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase
       (this correlates with [`PATCH`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic
       versioning).
    1. **feat:** a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the
       codebase (this correlates with [`MINOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in
       semantic versioning).
    1. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or
       appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change
       (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic
       versioning).
    A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
    1. _types_ other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example
       [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional)
       (based on the [the Angular
       convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines))
       recommends `build:`, `chore:`,
      `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
    1. _footers_ other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and
       follow a convention similar to [git trailer
       format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).

    Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification,
    and have no implicit effect in semantic versioning (unless they include a
    BREAKING CHANGE). <br /><br />
    A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual
    information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add
    ability to parse arrays`.

    ## Examples

    ### Commit message with description and breaking change footer
    ```
    feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

    BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
    ```

    ### Commit message with `!` to draw attention to breaking change
    ```
    refactor!: drop support for Node 6
    ```

    ### Commit message with both `!` and BREAKING CHANGE footer
    ```
    refactor!: drop support for Node 6

    BREAKING CHANGE: refactor to use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.
    ```

    ### Commit message with no body
    ```
    docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
    ```

    ### Commit message with scope
    ```
    feat(lang): add polish language
    ```

    ### Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers
    ```
    fix: correct minor typos in code

    ## Specification

    The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
    “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
    2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

    1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, `feat`,
       `fix`, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL `!`, and REQUIRED
       terminal colon and space.
    1. The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your
       application or library.
    1. The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your
       application.
    1. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun
       describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g.,
       `fix(parser):`
    1. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the
       type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code
       changes, e.g., _fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were
       contained in string_.
    1. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description,
       providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The
       body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
    1. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline
       separated paragraphs.
    1. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each
       footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a `:<space>` or
       `<space>#` separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the
       [git trailer
       convention](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers)).
    1. A footer's token MUST use `-` in place of whitespace characters, e.g.,
       `Acked-by` (this helps differentiate the footer section from a
       multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for `BREAKING CHANGE`, which
       MAY also be used as a token.
    1. A footer's value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST
       terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
    1. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit,
       or as an entry in the footer.
    1. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase
       text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g.,
       _BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config
       files_.
    1. If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated
       by a `!` immediately before the `:`. If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:`
       MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL
       be used to describe the breaking change.
    1. Types other than `feat` and `fix` MAY be used in your commit messages,
       e.g., _docs: updated ref docs._
    1. The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be
       treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING
       CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
    1. BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a
       token in a footer.

## Git flow

From [Scott Chacon blog](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html):

> - To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master
> - Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
> - When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request

`git remote` manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track.
```terminal
git remote -v
# If upstream is not configured, add the upstream route
git remote add upstream /url/original/repo

git fetch upstream

# reset master to upstream/master
git checkout master
git reset --hard upstream/master
git push --force

  y--y--y (mybranch)
 /
z--z--z   (master, upstream/master, origin/master)

# replay the patches (even they are rejected for now) on top of master
git checkout mybranch
git rebase master
git push -u origin mybranch

        y'--y'--y' (mybranch, origin/mybranch)
       /
z--z--z   (master, upstream/master, origin/master)
```
