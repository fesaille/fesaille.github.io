# Code coverage

!!! note ""
    In computer science, test coverage is a measure used to describe the degree
    to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test
    suite runs.


## Coverage criteria


There are a number of coverage criteria, the main ones being:

Function coverage
: has each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?

Statement coverage
: has each statement in the program been executed?

Edge coverage
: has every edge in the Control flow graph been executed?

Branch coverage
: has each branch (also called DD-path) of each control structure (such as in if and case statements) been executed? For example, given an if statement, have both the true and false branches been executed? This is a subset of edge coverage.

Condition coverage (or predicate coverage)
: has each Boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false?
