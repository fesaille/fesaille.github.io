    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The topics are intended to give you a mental map of the knowledge you need to thrive as a data scientist, and that you can continue to build on long after you graduate. This course mostly focuses on practical skills for data analysis. Algorithmic, statistical and machine learning theory will be reviewed where appropriate but is not emphasized. This does not mean that they are not important - I am just assuming that you have learned or will learn them in other courses. The number of topics is probably too much to realistically cover in a semester. Some topics will just be touched on briefly, and others introduced via homework assignments.\n",
