# Bash Testing: `bats`

 <badge-stars repo='bats-core/bats-core'></badge-stars> <badge-doc
 href='https://bats-core.readthedocs.io'></badge-doc> is a
 TAM-compliant testing framework for Bash.

!!! Info "Test Anything Protocol"

    [TAP](https://testanything.org/), the Test Anything Protocol, is a simple
    text-based interface between testing modules in a test harness. It
    decouples the reporting of errors from the presentation of the reports.

## Installation

### git based

```terminal
git submodule add https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git test/bats
git submodule add https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support.git test/test_helper/bats-support
git submodule add https://github.com/bats-core/bats-assert.git test/test_helper/bats-assert
```

## Basic commands
### `run`

`run` invokes its arguments as a command in a subshell, saves the exit status
and output into global variables: `$status` and `$output`.
`run` returns with a 0 status code so you can continue to make assertions in
your test case The `$lines` array is available for easily accessing individual
lines of output.

??? Example

    ```bash
    @test "invoking foo without arguments prints usage" {
      run foo
      [ "$status" -eq 1 ]
      [ "$output" = "foo: no such file 'nonexistent_filename'" ]
      [ "${lines[0]}" = "usage: foo <filename>" ]
    }
    ```

### `load`

`load` sources a Bash source file relative to the location of the current test
file.

??? Example

    ```bash
    load test_helper.bash
    ```

### `skip`

Tests can be skipped by using the skip command at the point in a test you wish to skip.

??? Example

    ```bash
    @test "A test which should run" {
      if [ foo != bar ]; then
        skip "foo isn't bar"
      fi

      run foo
      [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
    }
    ```

### `setup` and `teardown`
Pre- and post-test hooks have two scopes:

- `setup` and `teardown` functions run before and after each test case,
respectively.
- `setup_file` and `teardown_file` run once before the first test’s `setup` and
after the last test’s `teardown` for the containing file.

### Print to terminal

Text that is output directly to stdout or stderr (file descriptor 1 or 2), ie echo 'text' is considered part of the test function output and is printed only on test failures. To have text printed unconditionally from within a test function you need to redirect the output to file descriptor 3, eg `echo 'text' >&3`.

## Common assertions

bats-assert <badge-stars repo='bats-core/bats-assert'></badge-stars>  is a helper library
 providing common assertions:

- `assert` / `refute`: a given expression evaluates to true or false.
- `assert_equal`: two parameters are equal.
- `assert_success` / `assert_failure`: exit status is 0 or 1.
- `assert_output` / `refute_output`: output does (not) contain given content.
- `assert_line` / `refute_line`: a specific line of output does (not) contain
  given content.

## Common functions

bats-support <badge-stars repo='bats-core/bats-support'></badge-stars> is a
supporting library providing common functions to test helper libraries:

- Error reporting
- Output formatting
