## SQL within Python


For sql like data access, [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/index.html) consists of two distinct components, known as the **Core** (abstraction toolkit) and an optional but convenient **ORM** (Object Relational Mapper).

For analytics, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) provides facili tes and loads the data into the memory of the local host, [Ibis](https://docs.ibis-project.org/) leaves the data in its storage, and performs the computations there

For SQL command in jupyter, see the [SQL jupyter magic](https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql) and a [notebook example](https://github.com/satybald/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/MagicsSQL.ipynb)
